title: What scientific idea is ready for retirement?

teaser: This year's Edge Question 2014 was answered by 176 scientists, writers, philosophers, ... thinkers. One hundred and sixty seven pleas for a sane way of thinking.

The authors include renown professors, aged philosophers as well as young PhD candidates. The whole list is overwhelming, but you should definitely take some time to [browse through the list](http://www.edge.org/contributors/what-scientific-idea-is-ready-for-retirement). An impressive range of topics is covered. I just want to review a few themes that struck my eye. 

## Scientific practice and work ethics
Quite some suggestions target the necessity to change how science works in general. The most interesting points in my eyes are not the ones about scientific theory itself, the criticism of the falsificability of *good* theories, or the 
It's the criticism of actual everyday scientists work. 

I like very much the remark of [**Brian Christian**](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25514), that scientific literature in terms of a peer reviewed article publication is not the only valid scientific delivery. The process of its writing and reviewing is already a scientific product in its own right. He demands that the scientific publication process needs to be revised and adapted to the powerful and much speedier reality of the internet. He calls for a better resolution of the paper reference network, to help tracking dependencies on assumptions or tenets that might already be proved wrong. He also advocates the use of revision control systems like *git* in the process of research and writing. He questions the anonymity of peer review and suggests that a constructive contribution culture via discussing "issues" or "pull requests", powerful features of revision control, could make a more agile science.  

A great comment on work ethics in science is commited by [Kathryn Clancy](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25516) writing about the actual motors of scientific progress: fear and abuse. She describes that the vast majority of the scientific handiwork is done by students exploited by their superiors. The need for promotion in the harsh and selective environment of publish-or-perish demands ruthless leadership. It is a self perpetuating system that selects for elbows and quashes the truely valuable. Instead we need a change of culture towards team spirit and shared success, we neet to valorize diversity and creativity.
