teaser: For researchers it is a constant struggle to keep track of the literature. Everybody has an own priorisation and strategies to find and read this month's relevant papers. But always remember that some off-topic reading would be very healthy, as well!

My strategy in keeping track of published papers has branches of different importance:
 1.	Following references in papers I read 
 2. Scrolling through the current issue of relevant journals online
 2. Setting up paper alerts for certain topics *and* for fellow researchers 
 3. Reading blogs and science news
 
Of course, today this [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) rules in terms of scientific paper search, apparently. One reason is the social networking component which allows researchers to create an own profile page. Another reason is that they rule the web.  A while ago, Morgan Ernest advertised the feature of Google Scholar to create search alerts, or to follow a fellow researcher [on her blog](http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/24/using-google-scholar-to-keep-up-with-the-literature/). 

But Google neither maintains traditionally the best database nor are they free of conflict of interest. Even Morgan pointed out in her post, that Google migth turn out evil in the end. As an alternative, you can use the saved searches function of [Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge](http://apps.webofknowledge.com/). In my opinion, their search is more sound and allows applying additional filters by research field, journals, and the like (you could even filter for funding agencies, extracted from the acknowledgements). This allows you to create a search and eliminate all the off-topic articles that by chance share a common key-word or author with your target.

And the nice thing: You can even create an e-mail alert from that search. The feature is a little hidden and
