teaser: For researchers it is a constant struggle to keep track of the literature. Everybody has an own priorisation and strategies to find and read this month's relevant papers. But always remember that some off-topic reading would be very healthy, as well!

My strategies for keeping track of published papers (relevance decreasing):
 1.	Following references in papers I read
 2. Following citations of papers I read (using search tools)
 3. Checking out other papers of relevant authors
 4. recommendations of fellow researchers (on their blogs, via e-mail or twitter)
 7. Reading blogs and science news
 5. Scrolling through the current issue of relevant journals online
 6. Setting up paper alerts for certain topics *and* for fellow researchers 
 
 
You can think of your search strategy as a model that identifies the relevance of a paper to the topic of question. In that case, my list of search strategies is somehow messy and not very parsimonious. Usually, in meta-analyses or systematic reviews you would define only two or three very clear criteria that return a list of papers that you consider relevant. In reality, literature research is more gradual. 

In fact, the **google filter bubble** might be a real danger here: The amazing thing about search engines is that they know better what we are looking for than we do ourselves. Their filters know which papers were referenced together before, which scientific concepts are related to each other, which ideas build upon each other. If we relied on what google scholar returns as relevant and we would cite only that in articles, we would cement that association. It's a positive feed back. We would be caught in a filter bubble. 

Would we be able to make associations of ideas that nobody else put together before. Would it be the end of originality?

I really think that it is a good idea to read in breadth and never entirely rely on search engines. 
A bit more detail: 

## Following references and citations in papers I read
Looking for relevant references is quite trivial, I guess. And lazy as well. However, I find the way how the paper is cited in an article and the title of the paper are very good indicators of it's content. The search for citations of a relevant paper on the topic of question is the same thing but in the other direction. I usually search for the paper in Google Scholar or Web of Knowledge and click on citations. Here, I usually select for papers that were cited most frequently themselves. I guess this is quite a rough model. 
The most relevant authors are 
 
## The community
I think it is justified to spend quite some work-time reading blogs and comments. Blogposts are a valid publication by their own rights. 
In our working group we have the habit of sending around interesting papers, particularly ones of general scientific interest on ethics and practices in science. 
Maybe quite powerfull as well is following fellow researchers on Twitter, reducing the friction in scientific communication. I am not on Twitter myself but I visit some people or conversations on Twitter from time to time to browse.

**Science news** 

** Journal content**
I hardly ever read printed issues of journals. 

## Paper alerts
Of course, today this [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) rules in terms of scientific paper search, apparently. One reason is the social networking component which allows researchers to create an own profile page. Another reason is that they rule the web. A while ago, Morgan Ernest advertised the feature of Google Scholar to create search alerts, or to follow a fellow researcher [on her blog](http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/24/using-google-scholar-to-keep-up-with-the-literature/). 

Google is free of charge, but I dislike the idea of registering a google account, because you can't opt out of all the stuff attached to it like google+, gmail, and of complete surveillance of your private internet behaviour. The fact that it is free hints that you're not the customer but the product. Even Morgan pointed out in her post that Google migth turn out evil in the end. Mendeley might be an alternative, but it has pretty much the same downsides.

Since most universities subscribe to [Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge](http://apps.webofknowledge.com/) anyway, this might be a valuable substitute to create e-mail alerts. In my opinion, their search is even more sound and allows applying additional filters by research field, journals, and the like (you could even filter for funding agencies, extracted from the acknowledgements). This allows you to create a search and eliminate all the off-topic articles that by chance share a common key-word or author with your target. The feature for e-mail alerts is a quite hidden.
