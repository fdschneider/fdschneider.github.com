title: My Windows R-environment
---

I just write this down for myself to have it reproducible after my next system reset. I will try to keep the page up to date whenever I change things on the set-up. 
R has become by far my most important tool in science. It is worth some effort to optimize it for my own use. I usually run it on a Windows 8 System, but I use the capacities of a Linux server as well.
So my R-environment includes:

- the base R installation (currently 3.0.2 - 64bit)
- packages Rcpp, compiler, rbenchmarking, animation 
- Notepadd++ as editor, sometimes R Studio
- Rtools
- ImageMagick


- knitr and pandoc


## My Installation Directory
To keep everything together in one place, I set a central installation directory for all R related programs to `C:\R\`. 

## Base R 
### Install

### customize
default home directory
help file visualisation
personal functions

### Update

## Editor
### Notepad++

### Rproject



## packages

### Rcpp

#### Rtools
To get Rcpp running, you will need the [Rtools](http://ftp.igh.cnrs.fr/pub/CRAN/) collection. It contains many Linux based command line programs required 


### animation

#### ImageMagick


## Remarks
### a short note on `cygwin`


### ggplot2
You might realise that I do not use ggplot2
