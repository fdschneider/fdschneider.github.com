For scientists, a major part of their work actually is communication. I mean, all scientists are well aware that they very well have to publish articles. And, they are aware that they have to make them to have a *high impact*. This impact is achieved if they succeed to communicate. 
Good writing is one thing. But the complex results in science can not be transported by language alone. In many papers, figures do a good part of the job. 

I recently got myself the books of Edward Tufte. His publications are said to have revolutionised visual communication. At least that's what visual communicators say. Only very slowly, his principles made their way into scientific graphs as well. But they are far from being universally applied.

I want to summarize some of the points that I found extremely useful for my visual communication in science. 

## Data ink ratio
Occams razor on graphs. 
cluttery symbols
cluttery figure elements

## Color use

## Noise vs. detail
High resolution graphs allow the addition of small structured information. 
Tufte investigated the importance of detail, which makes figures highly credible, and differentiates it from noise, which distracts without adding information.
