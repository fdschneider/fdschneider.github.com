I really like that idea. 

Its not only that reading fiction can change the angle on particular topics, like mutations, human clones, epidemics. It can have a much depper impact and touch the way we think. How does science work? or what is nature, actually? What is a model? what is evidence?

This sounds like the novels necessarily need to be serious and deep. No! If there is one book I would recommend for assigning it to students it would be "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. There is so much to learn about probabilities and models.

Then "The Name of the Rose" by Umberto Eco, where the main character applies Ockhams Razor in a Sherlok Holmes like fashion to solve a series of murders in a medieval monastery. But he fails somehow, ending up with even more questions. A bit more abstract, you could also read it as a critique on collecting hughe amounts of knowledge in the ivory tower.

Finally, "The Road" by Cormack McCarthy is a dystopia of the post-ecosphere. All life is dying, only traumatised humans are left. 

Another reason for reading fiction is that you can teach something about storytelling and writing. You can't deny that a hughe part of the scientific work is storytelling and writing, e.g. for presentations and papers.  

And you wouldn't believe it: for very similar reasons we initiated a movie club in our lab, inviting all the students of the seminars and field courses as well. I always saw it as an opportunity to widen peoples perception of scientific work. Some movies afterwards ignited deep philosophical discussions. We mostly were watching movies with some relation to science, but not necessarily. 
For your movie club I'd suggest: "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" by Wes Anderson, Jurassic Park, "The Fountain" by Darren Arronofsky, "Temple Grandin" by Mick Jackson.

What?

Thank you very much for this revealing post and discussion.

I admit that I am a bit confused. I just was reading through the comments and apparently the consesus is: “Yeah right, Nobody works 80 hours a week. That’s insane. Telling people that it’s 80 hours is just stupid. Don’t do that. Actually, it’s only 50.”

What’s wrong with you people?

I agree, working 80 hours would be a clear sign of being inefficient as hell, probably corellated with hang around on comic blogs and newspages 60% of the time. I thought the 80 hours myth is rather like saying: “yeah, but it will cost a billion dollars!” when something is just ridiculously expensive. 80 hours is ridiculously exaggerated.

But 50 hours is still a lot. Its more than eight hours with one free day per week. Normal jobs demand 35 to 40 hours a week, you know? Most contracts, even in science, contain a number like that. 50 hours is almost two work days extra.

In my opinion, science is a creative job. It requires time to rest the mind and take a breath. And I believe, half a sunday a week off is not sufficient. In my imagination, the perfect workload would be rather something like 25 hours, let it be 4 days. But 50 hours? Come on!!! Are you even aware that people might consider this as insane?

You should face the fact that young researchers get depressed about this perspective and just leave academia. Science is selecting for people who are prepared to work more! This blogpost is just another proof.

Please don’t get me wrong: I am not saying that science is “just a job” and we need our spare time for personal things. I think, identification with the science you do and a hughe amound of idealism is obligatory, particularly in fields that are defined to improve society and save the environment. But we can do a better job if we take time to breathe. In my case: I am a theoretical ecologist. So, I work 98% of the time in front of the computer. It’s hardly healthy to work like that 50 hours a week. It might not reflect the reality of the majority of scientists. But what’s your computer work / other work ratio? I also accept that the 50 hour week might be a concept for some. If you consider something you do in your worktime as no actual work, like writing or reading blogs or general science news, thats fine. If your field trips always feel like vacation, thats fine. As long as you are balanced and happy with what you do.

But, honestly, are you?

I apologize if the tone was too harsh. 
But please understand that I wanted to be nothing but constructive. Let me put it in other words: "What is wrong with science?"

I admittedly was annoyed that your post and the discussion was elaborating on those "80 hours" and not on the actual problem: Overworking and competition in science filter out those young researchers who have a different concept of work in science. To those, the "50 hours (plusminus 5)" raised to a kind of GOLD standard by the discussion here are like a slap in the face. We need to appreciate creativity and diversity to make a science better. 

I think we all agree that the perception of workload is entirely subjective. We don't count hours in science and I like that very much. 
But we are in serious danger of working too much because there is an environmental pressure demanding it. We are not competitive if we do work to rule. Of course I work more. Okay, there is some reward like high flexibility and freedom about when and on what you work. But this seems luxury when I talk to many of my peers. For now, this flexibility is what holds me in science. But I'm not entirely happy with working that much. I feel that sooner or later,  it will make me quit science.

Thanks for that context. I am just a devoted sceptic.  
I agree that cultural norms are very important here and there is no way of telling if they are good or bad; and that there are different types of work which can be exhaustive or joy. And I totally second that working hours is not at all an indicator for measuring productivity.

Yes, true, I am currently working in France and worked in Germany before. I estimate that I work 45 hours per week and I would love to reduce it. Still, I like to work in science. I like it very much. But personally, I would prefer to earn less money and work less hours.
I am curious if you know somebody working half-time in science and with that manages to "succeed"? 
I feel, that the criteria applied for funding or employment depend on productivity , however you measure it, and create a pressure that hardly allows to go for an alternative strategy (like: be paid less, work less, produce less) even if it might benefit diversity in research. It is good to hear that people with kids can afford to work less and stay successful. But can you become successful while raising kids? And there are other reasons to be "only" part time scientist.
