title: GitHub offers for scientists
author: Florian D. Schneider
categories: blog
teaser: I was writing about git and version control or "open science" before. Now GitHub has developed a very supportive policy for scientists who want to make their work more transparent.

GitHub adds great features to your projects (beyond version control, which you should do anyway) such as Issue Tracking and Milestones, enabling an easy collaboration. 

By default, a GitHub repository is open to the public, since they want to foster open source code development. If you wanted to use GitHub to develop code or projects in private so that no one else can look into, you had to pay. 

However, when developing a scientific project or writing a manuscript you might not want to give everything away before you published it in a peer reviewed journal. I believe, this is not contradictory to the [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) idea.  In many fields, science is strongly competitive and we have to find ways to integrate openness and transparency in that environment. 

[Now Github provides researchers with private repositories for free](

). The idea is that you  "open source" these repositories along with your paper or once your project is finished. They even provide DOIs for repositories.

You just have to apply for personal private repositories (using an institutional e-mail adress) and you'll get 5 private repos for free (worth 7 <span>$</span> a month). You also can apply for entire project teams (granting you 20 repositories for free which is worth 50 <span>$</span> a month).

Hope that helps you to make your work more open.
