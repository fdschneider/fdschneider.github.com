The CASCADE project is funded by the EU to investigate catastrophic shifts in drylands in the Mediterranean region. This week, we are having our annual project meeting. It's quite exciting to meet again the project team including researchers  from England, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and of course Cyprus.
Here, very close to Paphos, we have one of the six field sites set up. It is particularly interesting for me, because it is the field site with the highest intensity of grazing.    
I put together some observations we made and thoughts we had while visiting the site. 

## Associational resistance to grazing

Now, in spring, many fast growing annuals are covering the ground, plus some fleshy, monocotyledone herbs that are known to be indigestible or poisonous.
The influence of grazing is obvious when looking at the shrubs: There is no single shrub without massive thorns. The plants have ridiculous shapes. Many form spiked cushions that are pressed firmly to the ground. Most are crouching, trying to wind away from some invisible force. Some are towering high and are surrounded by a natural fence of half-dead branches nibbled down to the woody parts. Often, plants of the same or different species are growing next to each other to form an associated patch. 
This effect is often referred to as Associational Resistance [^1], the protection against external pressures by local aggregation.

## Nurse and Protégé 
Building protective structures against grazing such as thorns is a costy investment for plants. Some plants are therefore free-riding on the protection provided by others.

In Cyprus, the plant is growing inside almost every other shrub. In the fenced plot, we also found it climbing dead wood, whereas in strongly degraded sites the plant was hardly found. 
It is a form of
