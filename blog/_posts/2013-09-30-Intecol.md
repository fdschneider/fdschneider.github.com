I just mounted the Eurostar train heading home to France from the marvelous INTECOL meeting 2013 in London. It’s the first silent moment this week and I still can here my brain humming from the things it has to process. When coming back from a conference I usually bring home countless ideas for projects, new interesting questions to adress, people to keep in touch with. It’s electric. But of course, the majority of these are lost in my notes and thoughts after a week of work in the homely environment.
That’s sad but just a process of natural selection, I guess. Only the most realistic projects will move on. Only the recurring questions will itch me. Only the most lovely people I will remember. So among the countless things I saw this week, which will be the fittest? I will try to note it down here, once I figured it out.
There is one thing i know already: The BES centenary party was paradoxically proving that the community of ecologists in the UK and Europe is younger than it ever was before. It feels great being a part of it.
