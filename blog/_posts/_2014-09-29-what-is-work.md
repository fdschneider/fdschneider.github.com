The editorial article is right: We need to rebrand what a PhD or a Postdoc means to us. It is not a stepstone to the universally worshiped, eternal professorship, how most of us see it (be very honest now!). This would inevitably mean, if we drop out of science, we fail. 10+ years of our lives lost, all the trouble for nothing?  
Instead, it should be an adventure on it's own. An acquisition of skills and an exploration of our passion. The highest goal should be to be bold, find encouragement, and follow our passion, an idea or inspiration, regardless if it is within research or outside.

Very enlightening, this infographic (go.nature.com/vh1ewm) showing that only about ten percent of PhDs end up with a permanent position in Science, which would make their carreer the 'alternative' one.
The second article also refers to a 2012 study showing empirically that people who were staying in science usually had had a more supportive mentor and a more secure economic environment.
I conclude that, if it happens: it is not us, failing at doing science. It is science failing us.

There is this brilliant talk of elizabeth gilbert on the fear of failure in creative work.
