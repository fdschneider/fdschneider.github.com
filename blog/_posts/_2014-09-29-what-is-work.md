The editorial article is right: We need to rebrand what a PhD or a Postdoc means to us. It is not a stepstone to the universally worshiped Eternal Professorship, how most of us see it (be very honest now!). This would inevitably mean, if we drop out of science, we fail. It would mean 10+ years of our lives lost. All the trouble for nothing?

Instead, it should be an adventure on it's own. An acquisition of skills and an exploration of our passion. The highest goal should be to be bold, find encouragement, and follow our passion, an idea or inspiration, regardless if it is within research or outside.

The articles on this topic written by researchers who 'made it' are usually written in an encouraging tone: If academia is not for you, you will find something else. You are highly qualified for more things than you can imagine. Look at all these examples.[^1]
This is good, but it also indirectly implies that such encouragement is necessary:  
"Please, some of you have to go. There is no place for all of you. We have to filter rigorously. You are not likely to make it. Better you go now. ... And never come back!"

It feels that it is really hard to take this step, since it does not drop the idea that a career in academia is the only 'good' way. Anyone else 'failed' in the struggle for the precious positions. I am not happy with this notion, and for those researchers who actually wound up in a different kind of job it is offending.

> please do not call us ‘failed’ [..].
>
> [...] it would be a huge mistake to assume that those who jump from the research career ladder were unable to hack it. [^2]

The article on nature points to [this infographic](go.nature.com/vh1ewm) from the American Society for Cell Biology, which I found very enlightening, showing that only about ten percent of PhDs end up with a permanent position in Science, ... which would make their career path the 'alternative' one.

The second article also refers to a 2012 study showing empirically that people who were staying in science usually had had a more supportive mentor and a more secure economic and private environment.
The conclusion would be that if it happens it is not us failing at doing science. It is science failing us.

I believe this is the right direction.

The entire debate would benefit from opening it up to a broader question. A question that actually encloses our struggle for contributing something we believe to be meaningful and important. It all spins around our perception of what we call 'work'.

There is this brilliant TED talk of Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of '', on the fear of failure in creative work.
