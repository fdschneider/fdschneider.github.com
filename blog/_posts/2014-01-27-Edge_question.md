The authors include renown professors, aged philosophers as well as young PhD candidates. The whole list is overwhelming, but you should definitely take some time to [browse through the list](http://www.edge.org/contributors/what-scientific-idea-is-ready-for-retirement). An impressive range of topics is covered. I enjoyed very much reading over it. I just want to review a few themes that struck my eye. 

## Scientific practice and work ethics

Quite some suggestions target the necessity to change how science works in general. The most interesting points in my eyes are not the ones about scientific theory itself, the criticism of the falsificability of *good* theories, or the 
It's the criticism of actual everyday scientists work. 

I liked very much the remark of [**Brian Christian**](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25514), that scientific literature in terms of a peer reviewed article publication is not the only valid scientific delivery. The process of its writing and reviewing is already a scientific product in its own right. He demands that the scientific publication process needs to be revised and adapted to the powerful and much speedier reality of the internet. He calls for a better resolution of the paper reference network, to help tracking dependencies on assumptions or tenets that might already be proved wrong. He also advocates the use of revision control systems like *git* in the process of research and writing. He questions the anonymity of peer review and suggests that a constructive contribution culture via discussing "issues" or "pull requests", powerful features of revision control, could make a more agile science.  

A great comment on work ethics in science is commited by [Kathryn Clancy](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25516) writing about the actual motors of scientific progress: fear and abuse. She describes that the vast majority of the scientific handiwork is done by students exploited by their superiors. The need for promotion in the harsh and selective environment of publish-or-perish demands ruthless leadership. It is a self perpetuating system that selects for elbows and quashes the truely valuable. Instead we need a change of culture towards team spirit and shared success, we neet to valorize diversity and creativity. 


## Of scientists and citizens

Two somewhat complementary titles made me muse about the archetype of scientist and how it is percieved in the public. They question the nature of the scientist: **"Only *Scientists* Can Do Science" by Kate Mills**  and **"Scientists Should Stick to Science"  by Buddhini Samarasinghe**. 

The first challenges that science is only science if done by a certified researcher. It's a plea for a true citizen science, going far beyond the stupid exploitation of brainpower for pattern recognition in Big Data sets (see below). Kate highlights that laymen, particularly children and teenagers, can enhance experimental design and formation of hypotheses, not *although*, but *because* they are untrained. An unprejudiced perspective can break thinking patterns and research traditions. 

The second essay points the other way round. Scientists are citizens, too. They conclude what they conclude because of evidence. And they give public counsel, because of this evidence. This is their responsibility as citizens. Buddhini observes a systemaic exclusion of scientists from the policy making process, but also a self-imposed moderation towards political neutrality. That is disturbing in a public environment where "a sensationalizing mainstream media and politicians seeking re-election \[make\] settled facts to appear tentative."

## The world is *sooo* complex

I believe a scientific task for the decades to come is how we implement life's complexity into our perception of nature. It's an epistemological question. We know today that there are no simple answers to complex problems, as (Gavin Schmidt)[http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25484], climatologist at NASAs Goddard Institute, points out in his answer to the Edge Question. We will never be able to resolve reality to a complicated machinery of dynamicaly interacting gears. There is no hope for science in absolute reductionism. Instead science must be percieved as a "method for producing incrementally more useful approximations to reality, not a path to absolute truth". 

If searching for a general principle for living systems, it is not to be found in the numbers itself. It is to be found in structures and rules. A fact that (Gary Marcus)[http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25512] highlights in his critique of the Big Data paradigm. Multivariate datasets, will never tell us something beyond simple correlation. They won't clarify cause and consequence. Big Data will help us to find evidence for well formulated mechanisms, yes, but we still have to figure these out first.
