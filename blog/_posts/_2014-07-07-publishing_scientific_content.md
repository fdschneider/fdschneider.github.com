title: "On Open Science Publishing and Licensing"

teaser: Data, computer code and manuscripts - the produce of scientific work. It is what we make. Nowadays, all of it has to be open access or open source. But why? Spoiler: It is for the greater good.

# All rights reserved?

The legal background to consider when making things publicly available on the internet is ... complicated, to be modest. It differs in the type of content, in national law, and in the purpose or use of the publication.
Let's start with the type of content: Traditionally, at least in Europe and the U.S., there is a distinction between creative and non-creative content. The assignment of content to these categories might differ.
Usually, Creative content is understood to be originally created by the author, such as text, pictures or music, whereas non-creative content is the result of repetitive and somehow standardized work, such as measurements, systematic image capturing, recordings, but also technical solutions, such as any kind of machines and computer code.  

The legal difference could not be more contrasting: **creative content** is *per se* protected by **copyright**, protecting the ownership and the right to capitalize, publish, reproduce and modify the work. It is important to note that the law in the US and UK secures the rights of the owner (usually the publisher), while the European law focuses on the actual author of the work, who has to do nothing but proof his authorship. In both cases the act of *publishing* is crucial. Most national laws make sure copyright expires after a very, very long period.

On the other hand, **non-creative work** is unprotected by copyright. If they decide to publish or give away their work *and* want to protect their commercial interests, the authors have to claim the ownership and the rights to be the only ones to reproduce and build upon the work by putting it under an explicit **license or patent**. A special case are databases: Europe has a database right that allows to put the work of assembling data using standardized efforts to a database under property right [^2]. Nothing of that kind exists in the U.S..

*Summary:* Non-licensed creative work is, once published, by default under copyright, and therefore not free to use or distribute (ownership definition differs by country!). Non-licensed non-creative work, such as computer code or data, unless stated otherwise can be re-used and developed by anybody who gets hands on it.

As you can imagine, the legal history of copyright and ownership rights is very particular for each country. And surprise: there are serious conflicts between the commercial interests of publishers and companies and the public interest of data and knowledge availability. But who's side are we, the authors, on?

# Why Open Licenses instead of Copyright for Scientific work

There are many reasons why you might want to clarify the terms and conditions for the use of your work by putting it under a specific license.

- publish but protect:
- facilitate re-use: If you want to facilitate the use of your code or data, add a *permissive* or a *copyleft* license.
- reduce limits for distribution:
- non-commercial, non-governmental interest:
- public interest:


What kind of license concepts are there?

## copyleft licenses

## permissive licenses

## public domain licenses



When publishing project repositories after the paper is published, it is important to add legal licenses to define how your code, data and text can be used.

Who do you develop code for? For yourself, to boost your own research success? Keep it private and think about patents.

You want to publish the code for documentation, and reproducibility of your research? Also includes to increase your impact and the perception of your work? You do not encourage re-use of your code, because it is specific and developed for a particular project? Then, the first thing to take care for is the exclusion of liability with a license that is not necessarily encouraging re-use. The best for that is probably a   CC-by-nc-nd license for content and (something similar for code?).


Where to publish?

Very interesting: As a unique feature, this internationally valid license does not only cover written content, but also databases that are considered ‘non-creative’ work by law. It becomes therefore much easier to put scientific work under licenses, because you only need one license for content and one for code (which is not covered by CC4).



# Types of content

type of content | c
--------------- |--------------
 creative       | written text, graphics and visualisations, paintings and drawings, presentations, photographs, video, music
 non-creative   |  

## Creative Content
Written text, graphics and visualisations, Presentations, Photographs, Video, music, music notation.

## Non-creative content
This is pure information content. outcome of hard work of data collection, databases. Legal differences between Europe and US. In US no copyright for information possible. In Europe, database rights. ### Code Technical content. Code is considered to be a mashine, mechanism, algorithm. This is traditionally covered by patents. Legally no copyright possible.

### Code

#### Where to publish?

GitHub or similar, Own website, Journal website,

Give it a DOI.

#### How to license?

There is a lot of literature on how to license scientific code. As for all opensource projects, there is a debate between permissive and copyleft licenses.
