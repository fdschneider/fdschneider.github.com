teaser: "In 2013, Dave McElroy, Eoin O'Gorman, and Mark Emmerson invited my to contribute to a mesocosm study performed in Queen's University Marine Laboratory in Portaferry, Northern Ireland. By ensuring a size-balanced experimental design we were able to measure the community response to two anthropogenic pressures at the same time: warming and nutrient enrichment. We found that the short-term effects of anthropogenic pressures were stronger than the expected long-term shifts in consumer body mass. I am very happy about this paper finally being published ([doi: 10.1111/gcb.13019](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.13019/abstract))."

The paper's title is "Size-balanced community reorganization in response to nutrients and warming" and it was a great team effort of all authors: David J. McElroy, Eoin J. O'Gorman, Florian D. Schneider, Hanne Hetjens, Prune Le Merrer, Ross A. Coleman and Mark Emmerson.
