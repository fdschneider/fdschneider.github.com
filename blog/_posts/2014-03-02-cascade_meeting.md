The CASCADE project is funded by the EU to investigate catastrophic shifts in drylands in the Mediterranean region. This week, we are having our annual project meeting. It's quite exciting to meet again the project team including researchers  from England, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and of course Cyprus.
Here, very close to Paphos, we have one of the six field sites set up. It is particularly interesting for me, because it is the field site with the highest intensity of grazing. In the direct surrounding of the experimental site, at least four goat farms employ intensive grazing. The goats are free to walk around in the entire area and leave their marks in the landscape.

I put together some observations we made and thoughts we had while visiting the site. 

## Associational resistance to grazing
Now, in spring, many fast growing annuals are covering the ground, plus some fleshy, monocotyledone herbs that are known to be indigestible or poisonous.

The influence of grazing is obvious when looking at the shrubs: There is no single shrub without massive thorns. The plants have ridiculous shapes. Many form spiked cushions that are pressed firmly to the ground. Most are crouching, trying to wind away from some invisible force. Some are towering high and are surrounded by a natural fence of half-dead branches nibbled down to the woody parts. Often, plants of the same or different species are growing next to each other to form an associated patch. 

This effect is often referred to as Associational Resistance [^1], the protection against external pressures by local aggregation.

## Nurse and protégé 

Building protective structures against grazing such as thorns is a costy investment for plants. Some plants are therefore free-riding on the protection provided by others. In such cases we speak of 'nursing'. The plant providing the protection is called the nurse, the one benefiting is the protégé. It is however unclear, if the nurse has some gain from hosting the protégé, or rather suffers from competition or increased attractivity to grazers.

In Cyprus, we found a flowering plant growing inside almost every other shrub. In the fenced sites without goats, we also found it climbing dead wood, or growing extended  whereas in strongly degraded sites the plant was hardly found. 

## Erosion

We found strongly eroded areas, usually in the valeys between two facing slopes. It is hard to say what started this process: water runoff or grazing. Probably, both processes enhance each other. I imagine that in those areas shrubs are grazed more intensely, because they have high growth rates due to good water supply. The grazing activity and the trampling of the goats reduces herbs and grasses and erodes the top soil. From a certain point, water runoff does more harm than good. It washs away all nutrients and seeds. This makes it even easier for goats to walk and graze in that places. Their trails become wider and deeper. Now, exceptional rainfall events can cause severe damage and carve rills in the soil and expose the shrubs' roots. It takes a while but in the long run even the formerly well protected shrubs are doomed.

## Aerial approach

All those processes shape the plant individuals, the vegetation patches, the entire landscape. In CASCADE we investigate the interplay of all the mechanisms and how they might turn a formerly vegetated and productive landscape into a barren desert.  The best way to describe changes on the landscape scale, like the spatial structure of the vegetation, is to look on it from above. That is why we have people of the Technical University of Cyprus in Limassolon on board who are experts for aerial imagery.

They investigate changes over time from historical time series of satellite images and provide us with high resolution, air-borne images from all kinds of drones. Of course they showed us their little toys.
