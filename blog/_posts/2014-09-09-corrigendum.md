title: Corrigendum to <br> Schneider, Scheu & Brose (2012) *Ecology Letters*
author: Florian Schneider
date: 09/09/2014
teaser: I made a mistake in [one of my research papers](https://fdschneider.github.io/publications/schneider_2012/)! It struck me very hard, since it was my very first research paper, and it was published in a very prestigious journal. The consequence? Join Open Science!

A Corrigendum article is now accessible online at the [Ecology Letters Website](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12333). 
It describes an updated parameter set that produces simulation outcomes that are in line with the conclusions of the paper, as well as a corrected dataset. 

To prevent that flaws in the code can go unnoticed, we also provide the full data set as well as the code for simulations and analysis on [GitHub](https://github.com/fdschneider/Schneider_et_al_2012_Corrigendum) ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.10878](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10878) ).

Admittedly, the triggering request by Tomas Jonsson, who was not able to reproduce our simulation results, came already almost a year ago. I figured out quickly that I was to blame for this confusion and provided a fix. 
I also started to read anything I could find about open science standards, reproducible research, version control, open source and open access. 

In fact, that really changed the way I work!

Still, bringing the code and data into the right format, finding somebody who does a pre-publication review (Kevin Cazelles! thanks again!), and figuring out the best way to publish it online took until now.

Please feel invited to make use of it and to discuss questions through the [issue tracking of GitHub](https://github.com/fdschneider/Schneider_et_al_2012_Corrigendum/issues) or by writing an [e-mail](florian.schneider@univ-montp2.fr).
