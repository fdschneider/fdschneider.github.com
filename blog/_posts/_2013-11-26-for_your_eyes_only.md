As a scientist in a national research institute, I consider myself a part of a body aquiring knowledge and understanding of our reality for the good of society. Even from a rather rational and less ethical point of view, we owe the taxpayer our loyalty.   
Therfore, when it is about work, I love openness and transparency without borders.

In private life, however, the opposite is true. Privacy is a civil right of high value. Only through privacy, we are enabled to communicate freely with each other, to think freely, to be individuals. Privacy must be protected! For [different reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_global_surveillance_disclosures), I believe that our governments have given up on that. That is why we need to take care. But what can we do? 

Well, apart from political action, we must [raise our shields](https://www.prism-break.org). 

Right after improving my webbrowser, I learned how to write encrypted e-mails. It takes two to write an encrypted mail. That is why I want to share how that works and encourage to use it for private (or sensible professional) communication. 

## Mozilla Thunderbird
Most e-mailing software provides encryption or allows the installation of add-ons that do provide it. The most widespread certainly is Mozilla Thunderbird. And it's the one I use. It also is open-source software, meaning that developers can always review the code of the software to search for privacy leakages or backdoors.
 
To encrypt you need two things. 
- a software called **GPG** to create and manage your private and public keys. 
- a plug-in called **Enigmail** to use the encryption for your e-mails.
