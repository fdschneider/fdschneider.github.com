title: "Suddenly, I was a git expert"
categories: computer, practice, science
author: Flo Schneider
date: "2014-11-28"
teaser: "Last monday, I hseld a git workshop for the people in our lab. Just after one year of using git version control for my own work, I am considered kind of an expert. That seems to reveal how little computational scientists in ecology and evolution care about version control and open source code."

It actually was the second time, I was talking about git version control in front of colleagues. Besides I was writing about it [here](https://fdschneider.github.io/blog/2013/version_control/) and in our working group wiki. I am not just another open science guru. It is because I believe in the benefits of version control that I want to share the idea and enable other people to use it.

So, I am sharing the slides here (CC-BY, [original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cascade-wp6/git_intro/)):
