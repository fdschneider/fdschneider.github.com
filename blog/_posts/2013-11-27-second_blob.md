title: Mapping the TED-o-sphere 
---
In a recent talk on TED, **Eric Berlow** and **Sean Gourley** were presenting an astonishing analysis of the meme-ome of 24.000 Talks. By measuring the common vocabulary in the talks, they define quantitative links and map those in multidimensional space. The result is colorfully separating thematic fields and allows to identify central key talks, interdisciplinary synthesis talks, or individualist talks (the latter maximize the Colleen Flanigan Index, termed after the most unique of unique talks).
Truely, a brilliant way to “see what has been said and see what’s not been said”.
