teaser:  There is a lot happening at the open research front. The idea is that making the entire research process, from the raw data to the writing and publishing, transparent to the community would boost the process of knowledge development. Research would become more reproducible, better documented, and more agile. Intriguing?

Sharing code. 
Sharing writing.


There are a couple of initiatives that are promoting the general idea of Open Research or focus on parts of it. For instance, [rOpenSci]() collects software packages that unify empirical data and facilitate their analysis. They collaborate with [GitHub](http://ropensci.org/), *the* platform for open source software development.
