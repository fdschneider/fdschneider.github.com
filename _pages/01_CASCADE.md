The [CASCADE project](http://www.cascade-project.eu/) investigates sudden regime shifts in dryland ecosystems, particularly in the Mediterranean. Arid ecosystems are suffering from climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Those combined stressors can lead to the permanent loss of vegetation. My PostDoc in Montpellier is dedicated to the development of models that reproduce these shifts. Such models serve the evaluation of indicators of early warning as well as the development of sustainable land use strategies. 

CASCADE is funded by the Framework Programme 7 of the European Comission. <!-- more -->


## Catastrophic shifts as consequence of multiple feed-backs
The response of the whole ecosystem to stress depends on the very local effects between plant individuals. These stressors can be abiotic, such as decreased precipitation and increased temperature due to climate change. But there are biotic sources of stress as well: Many landscapes in the mediterranean are intensely grazed by sheep or goats. In this first sub-project we develop a model to estimate how grazing in addition to abiotic effects changes the face of a landscape in terms of vegetation cover and patch structure.
 
The model I am using is based on a model of local facilitation developed by Sonia Kéfi[^1]. It is a cellullar automaton, i.e. it defines growth and mortality of plants with very simple rules on the local scale. The number of plants in the direct neighborhood of a cell determines its probability of accumulating organic matter or beeing colonised. 


## Density dependend grazing pressure
Previous landscape approaches on the effect of grazing used a rather abstract conception. Grazing intensity was defined to increase individual plant mortality linearly. In nature, the grazing pressure on an individual plant depends on the vegetation cover non-linearly (functional response). The precise shape of this non-linear function depends on many things, like the foraging behaviour and body mass of the grazers, but in rangelands, also on the management decisions of the shepperd and the governance regime of the region. We are aiming at a conceptional framework that allows a meaningful translation between model and metrics of land use management.

## Facilitation and speciation
The model so far is not differentiating plant species. All plant individuals behave in the same way. We want to add a layer of complexity by introducing plant functional groups that differ, for instance in their reliance on facilitation and their vulnerability to grazing. Those sub-projects are currently explored by two Master Students in our group, Marina Rillo and Alain Danet.
