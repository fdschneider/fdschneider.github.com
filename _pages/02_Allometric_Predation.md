During my PhD at the Technische Universität Darmstadt and the Georg-August Universität Göttingen with [Ulrich Brose](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/196267.html), I studied multi-predator communities. Many aspects of predation can be estimated from the species' average individual body mass. This allows the prediction of quality and quantity of interaction strengths in natural food webs. <!-- more --> The network approach bridges the physiological properties of individuals and dynamic interactions within complex, multi-predator communities and provides a mechanistic view on ecosystems. 

## Allometric species identity
The approach of allometric ecology is quite simple. It assumes that for many questions taxonomic species identities can just be ignored, because large parts of the individual physiology, behaviour and consequently it's ecology can be assigned to the animals' body mass.
This simplification is quite radical but incredibly useful.
Since body mass is quite easy to measure in the field or in experiments, this allows us to interpolate known physiological or ecological properties for any species. 
For instance, we can estimate a species' food uptake, it's movement speed or guess it's role in the food chain. 

## Allometric community ecology
Ecosystems are composed of many species. Ecology is a notoriously underfinanced field, so we don't have the time and means to count and measure all the individuals of each single species, let alone investigate their respiration rates, their feeding preferences or their breeding behaviour. For most species all these particular numbers are not known at all. If we would look close enough into any of earth's ecosystems, we would find species that were never described before.
Allometric community ecology is a rough but very useful approximation. We can estimate all these things just by counting and measuring a sample of each species in the community. We can even project the dynamic development of this community over time, the importance of particular species or their risk of extinction.
Of course not to the point and not with absolute certainty, but more universal and with less effort than with any other means.

## Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
This dynamic capability of the allometric approach allows us to create somehow realistic food webs by random. We can explore how a large variety of these random food webs, composed of many random species behaves under different conditions. We can adress questions like, "Which species are more robust, the big or the small?", "How do processes and functions of the community depend on biodiversity?". 
It's a playground for the large ecological questions.
