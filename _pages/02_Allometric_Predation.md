During my PhD at the Technische Universität Darmstadt and the Georg-August Universität Göttingen with [Ulrich Brose](http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/196267.html), I studied multi-predator communities. Many aspects of predation can be estimated from the species' average individual body mass. This allows the prediction of quality and quantity of interaction strengths in natural food webs. <!-- more --> The network approach bridges the physiological properties of individuals and dynamic interactions within complex, multi-predator communities and provides a mechanistic view on ecosystems.
