title: Allometric predation structures marine intertidal communities
date: 2011-11-30

teaser: "Climatic shifts often induce changes in population size structure, particularly at the top of the food web. In a series of experiments we induced systematic changes in the population structure of the shore crab *Carcinus maenas*, a common top level predator in intertidal communities. This triggered responses throughout the entire community, reaching down to the algal primary productivity."
partners: Mark Emmerson, Tasman P. Crowe, Eoin J. O'Gorman, Malte Jochum, Dave McElroy

Two experiments were performed so far: A field mesocosm study at Lough Hyne Marine Reserve in the south-west of Ireland, and a large microcosm study at the [Queen's University Marine Laboratory](https://www.facebook.com/queensmarinelab) in Portafery, Northern Ireland.

## Malte's mesocosm study at Lough Hyne marine reserve

In 2011, for his undergrad project Malte Jochum from GÃ¶ttingen initiated a close collaboration with Eoin O'Gorman who did a PostDoc in Dublin with Tasman Crowe. We ran a field mesocosm experiment at Lough Hyne Marine Reserve in the south-west of Ireland to investigate the consequences of changes in population size structure.
