title: About myself
---

My name is Florian Schneider and I am an ecologist. I am currently working at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Montpellier, France. 

I am biologist by training and specialised on theoretical ecology. This means I am formulating ecological processes in simple math and run simulations on the computer. This allows for a better understanding of those processes, which usually are so complex that they cannot be assessed by experimentation. <!-- more --> 

Nonetheless, experimentation with real organisms and investigation of data from the field are necessary to inform those models. They allow to extract realistic parameters and provide test data to evaluate the model. If a model fails to reproduce the observations in controlled experiments, it is not taking all the relevant elements of the system into account. 

## Academia

I enrolled at the Technical University Darmstadt in fall 2002. Beside my courses in ecology, I attended modules in the interdisciplinary study program environmental sciences ("Interdisziplinärer Studienschwerpunkt Umweltwissenschaften"), which treated multiple topics (like Climate Change, Renewables, Environmental Law, Biodiversity, Social Responsibility, Flooding) with integrated teaching concepts by an interdisciplinary teaching staff. In January 2009, I graduated on the topic "Effects of predator diversity and intra-guild predation on ecosystem function".

I continued research on the conjoint effects of multiple-predators on a basal ressource during my PhD in the group of Ulrich Brose in Darmstadt and Göttingen. The project included experimental and theoretical work. In the laboratory, I measured feeding interactions in dependence of the species' body masses (i.e. allometric functional response models) and run microcosm-studies with multiple predators from the forest litter layer on a standardised prey community. Using Allometric Theory, I successfully developed a model describing the feeding interactions of the predators in isolation and embeded in a community, only based on the body mass structure of the involved species. This simplifying approach allows the estimation of large parts of complex community effects without a detailled knowledge on the taxonomic species. Finally, I was able to apply this multi-predator model to generalise the relationship between predator diversity and ecosystem functioning in a simulation of a large gradient of predator species richness.
My PhD was funded by a three-year fellowship of the ["Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt" (DBU)](https://www.dbu.de/340.html).

In January 2013, I started a two-year PostDoc at the Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution in Montpellier (ISEM) with [Sonia Kéfi](http://sonia.kefi.fr). This position is part of [CASCADE, a project funded by the European Commission on catastrophic shifts in drylands](http://www.cascade-project.eu/).
