title: About this website
---

Thank you for finding this website. 

It is meant to be my web presence as a researcher. I am a theoretical ecologist, so you can expect contents on ecology, biology and science in general, as well as remarks on the technical aspects of my research, i.e. programming and information technology.

I am aiming at a minimalist, print-like layout because I believe that the reading experience benefits from that. Right now, there is no commenting function yet. If you feel like giving feed-back, please don't hesitate to contact me via e-mail.
