title: About this website
---

Thank you very much for finding this website. 

<br>

It is meant to be my web presence as a researcher. I am a theoretical ecologist, so you can expect content on ecology, biology and science in general, as well as remarks on the technical aspects of my research, i.e. programming, communication and information technology.

I am aiming at a minimalist, print-like layout because I believe that the reading experience benefits from that. The beautiful font that I make use of is called *Vollkorn 3.0.1* and it was designed by by [Friedrich Althausen](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/) and liberally released under [Open Font Licence](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web).

This is a static website hosted at [Github.com](https://github.com/fdschneider) benefiting from *GitHub Pages*. The sites are generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The navigation of the web-site is trying to be intuitive. Simple menus without deep hierarchies and teaser overview pages of the blog and research site enable to find content quickly. Feedback is appreciated. 

Right now, there is no commenting function yet. If you feel like giving feed-back, please don't hesitate to contact me via e-mail.
