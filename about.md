My name is Florian Schneider and I am a scientist.

I am biologist by training and specialised on theoretical ecology. This means I am re-building ecological processes in simple math and run simulations in the computer. This allows for a better understanding of those processes, which usually are so complex that they cannot be assessed by experimentation.

Nonetheless, experimentation with real organisms and investigation of data from the field are  necessary to inform those models. They allow to extract realistic parameters and provide test data to evaluate the model. If a model fails to reproduce the observations in controlled experiments, it is not taking all the relevant elements of the system into account.

Current project

Modeling dryland vegetation structure using a facilitation model that includes various parameters such as water availability, functional group richness and grazing. This is part of the CASCADE Project (Catastrophic shifts in Drylands: how can we prevent ecosystem degradation) which is co-funded by the European Commission under Framework Programme 7.

Previous work

I enrolled at the Technical University Darmstadt in fall 2002. Beside my courses in ecology, I attended modules in the interdisciplinary study program environmental sciences (« interdisziplinärer Studienschwerpunkt Umweltwissenschaften »), which treated multiple topics (like Climate Change, Renewables, Environmental Law, Biodiversity, Social Responsibility, Flooding) with integrated teaching concepts by an interdisciplinary teaching staff. In January 2009, I graduated on the topic “Effects of predator diversity and intra-guild predation on ecosystem function”.

I continued research on the conjoint effects of multiple-predators on a basal ressource during my Ph.D. in the group of Ulrich Brose in Darmstadt and Göttingen . The project included experimental and theoretical work. In the laboratory, I measured feeding interactions in dependence of the species’ body masses (i.e. allometric functional response models) and run microcosm-studies with multiple predators from the forest litter layer on a standardised prey community. Using Allometric Theory, I successfully developed a model describing the feeding interactions of the predators in isolation and embeded in a community, only based on the body mass structure of the involved species. This simplifying approach allows the estimation of large parts of complex community effects without a detailled knowledge on the taxonomic species. Finally, I was able to apply this multi-predator model to generalise the relationship between predator diversity and ecosystem functioning in a simulation of a large gradient of predator species richness.

My Ph.D. research was funded by a three-year fellowship of the « Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt » (DBU).
