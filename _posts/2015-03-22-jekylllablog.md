title: "announcing jekyll-lablog v0.2"
date: "2015-03-22"
author: Flo Schneider
teaser: After a while of leaving the project at rest, I finally pushed some features that I already developed a while ago, into version 0.2 of the [jekyll-lablog template](https://fdschneider.github.io/jekyll-lablog/).
---

If you want to get started, just install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and clone the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fdschneider/jekyll-lablog).

**New features:**

- New **typeset using Open Sans and minimalist icons** (compiled using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/)).
- A dark, **responsive menu**. It smartly provides direct links to all pages or posts that have a `menu:` variable specified in their yml header.
- Revised **footer**, including links and icons and an RSS/Atom feed.
- Manage your **projects** using a layout file that collects all content that has a specific **tag**.
- Automatically **collapse completed tasks** (toggle switch will follow).
- Enable **multiple tasklists**, that are compiled into a long one.
