title: Allometric Predation

During my PhD at the Technische Universität Darmstadt and the Georg-August Universität Göttingen, I studied multi-predator communities. Many aspects of predation can be estimated from the species' average individual body mass. This allows the prediction of quality and quantity of interaction strengths in natural food webs.
