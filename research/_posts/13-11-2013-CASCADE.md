The [CASCADE project](http://www.cascade-project.eu/) investigates sudden regime shifts in dryland ecosystems, particularly in the Mediterranean. Arid ecosystems are suffering from climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Those combined stressors can lead to the permanent loss of vegetation. My PostDoc in Montpellier is dedicated to the development of models that reproduce these shifts. Such models serve the evaluation of indicators of early warning as well as the development of sustainable land use strategies. 
CASCADE is funded by the Framework Programme 7 of the European Comission.
